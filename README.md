### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**About Me**
I am a fullstack .NET software developer with a penchant for React. I was born in South Africa, and have lived in the UK, Austria and Spain, before settling in Sweden. It was in Stockholm where I discovered the fullstack course at the School of Applied Technology, allowing me to leave the hospitality industry after 15 years and finally begin my career in programming.
